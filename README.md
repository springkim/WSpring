Windows(x64) Programming Library & Tool Setup Project
-----------------------------------------------------

### Global/Local

Global install is installing library on compiler directory. It can run directly your source code without any settings. Local library is installing library on your project directory. You have to use local library if you consider move or release your project.
In this project will install library as global.

### x86/x64

Drop x86(32bit application). x86 is past technology on desktop computer. Actually many libraries don't support x86 system.

### Shared/Static

This option is actually not important. But consider if you want use independent executable file. But static library depends on compiler. MSVC14's library will not work on MSVC15. So we use shared library.

### <img src="img/opencv.png" width="64">OpenCV

<img src="img/ver_latest.png" height="20">

**[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)** is open source computer vision library. Please install opencv correctly way. Many people install opencv strange way *(e.g. C:/Opencv)* . Also OpenCV dropped C interface after version 3.0. So you need to install both 2.4.X and 3.X if you are C/C++ programmer.

Usually, we use gcc(MinGW64), g++(MinGW64), Visual Studio(/TC), Visual Studio(/TP) in Windows OS for C/C++.  
It will install opencv2.x for C compiler and install opencv3.x(contrib,world) for C++ compiler.

This Installer will change something. That will select automatically correct version for your compiler.

gcc and /TC will select OpenCV2.X.

g++ and /TP will select OpenCV3.x(contrib).

So, You don't have to any settings for Visual Studio. library link command(#pragma comment) is already wrote in opencv header file. and all dll is copied to System folder.

But you need link libraries in MinGW64.
Here is sample build command using environment variable.
```batch
gcc <...> %opencv2%
```
```batch
g++ <...> %opencv3%
```

Likewise library link command is in cblas.h. You just need to include. and if you are using gcc then link below command.

```batch
gcc <...> -lopenblas
```

There is a example code in [tests/OpenBLAS_Tests](tests/OpenBLAS_Tests).
