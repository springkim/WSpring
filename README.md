##### <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j2JVXi9.png" width="48"> install_opencv.bat

opencv 3.3.1 world build for **Visual studio**(2010,2012,2013,2015), **MinGW64** and **python 2.7**.

This script will generate opencv's include,lib and bin in system folder.

So you don't have to set path when you are using visual studio. You need to only `#include<opencv2/...>`.

And in python2.7, just typing `import cv2`.
