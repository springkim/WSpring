## Windows(x64) Programming Library & Tool Setup Project

### Global/Local

Global install is installing library on compiler directory. It can run directly your source code without any settings.
Local library is installing library on your project directory. You have to use local library if you consider move or release your project.

For example in MSVC14(Visual Studio 2015), you need include directory and library directory. You can check below. This scripts will download modules in this directory.

### x86/x64
Drop x86(32bit application). x86 is past technology on desktop computer.
Actually many libraries don't support x86 system.

### Shared/Static

This option is actually not important. But consider if you want use independent executable file.
But static library depends on compiler. MSVC14's library will not work on MSVC15.
So we use shared library.
### Global directories
**Dll location** : `C:\Windows\System32`
##### MSVC14(Visual Studio 2015)
**Include directory** : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\include\`

**Library directory** : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\lib\amd64\`

##### MSVC12(Visual Studio 2013)
**Include directory** : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include\`

**Library directory** : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib\amd64\`

##### MinGW64
**Include directory** : `C:\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include\`

**Library directory** : `C:\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\`

### Program directories
**Program directory** : `C:\Program Files`

**Startup directory** : `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`

## Libraries

<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/33ljz1j.png" height="20">
<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/w0rf61.png" height="20">

**[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)** is open source computer vision library. Please install opencv correctly way. Many people installed opencv strange way *(e.g. C:/Opencv)* . Also OpenCV dropped C interface after version 3.0. So you need to install both 2.4.X and 3.X if you are C/C++ programmer. And i prepare contrib build scripts too.
This script will install opencv3.X,2.4.X *(prebuilt)* library in **VS2015,VS2013,VS2012,VS2010,MinGW64,Python2** and **Python3**.

You don't have to any settings for Visual Studio and Python. But you need link libraries in MinGW64.
It automatically selects opencv version. For example in gcc or Visual Studio(/TC) it will use opencv 2.4.X. and g++ or Visual Studio(/TP) it will use opencv 3.X.
